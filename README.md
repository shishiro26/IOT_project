# IoT Project: Lightweight Hashing for IoT Data Security

This repository contains the implementation of a semester IoT project focused on securing sensor data using cryptographic hashing techniques. The project integrates multiple IoT sensors, collects real-time data, and applies lightweight cryptographic hash functions to ensure efficient and secure data transmission. This implementation is based on the paper *"LNMNT - New Mersenne Number based Lightweight Crypto Hash Function for IoT"*.

## Introduction

IoT devices generate vast amounts of data, making it critical to secure this data efficiently for resource-constrained environments. This project implements the *LNMNT lightweight hash function, a cryptographic technique designed to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust security. We compare LNMNT's performance with the widely used **SHA-256* hash function to demonstrate its effectiveness.

## Features

1. *Lightweight Cryptographic Hashing*:
   - Implemented the LNMNT hash function using Mersenne primes for optimized performance on IoT devices.
   - Real-time comparison with SHA-256.

2. *Sensor Data Collection*:
   - Integrated real-time data collection from accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and geolocation sensors.

3. *Data Sharing*:
   - Secure transmission of hashed sensor data to a server.
   - Retrieval and display of recent shared data.

4. *Performance Metrics*:
   - Real-time calculation of hashing time for both algorithms.
   - Performance visualization and logging.

5. *User Interaction*:
   - Dynamic toggling between hash algorithms with visual feedback (button color changes).

## Implemented Sensors

- *Accelerometer*: Measures acceleration along x, y, and z axes.
- *Gyroscope*: Captures rotational motion data.
- *Magnetometer*: Detects magnetic field variations.
- *Geolocation*: Tracks position (latitude, longitude, altitude, and heading).

## Hash Functions

### 1. *LNMNT Hash Function*
   - Based on Mersenne primes for modular arithmetic.
   - Utilizes a Number Modulo Transform (NMNT) for efficient hashing.
   - Outputs a hexadecimal hash string.

### 2. *SHA-256*
   - Industry-standard cryptographic hash function.
   - Provides a 256-bit hash output.

The user can toggle between these functions to observe differences in performance and applicability to IoT use cases.

## Project Workflow

1. *Sensor Data Acquisition*:
   - Collect data from all sensors and format it as a JSON object.

2. *Hashing*:
   - Apply the selected hash function (LNMNT or SHA-256) to the sensor data.

3. *Data Transmission*:
   - Send hashed data and metadata to a remote server via a REST API.

4. *Data Retrieval*:
   - Fetch recent hashed data from the server for verification and display.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- *Node.js* and *npm/yarn* installed.
- *React Native CLI* setup for mobile app development.
- *Expo* for geolocation and sensors management.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IOT_Project.git
2. Install dependencies:
    bash
    npm install
3. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm run start

## Performance Comparison
The project evaluates:

- *Hashing Time*: LNMNT significantly outperforms SHA-256 on IoT devices due to reduced computational complexity.

- *Security*: While LNMNT offers lightweight security for IoT contexts, SHA-256 remains the gold standard for applications requiring stronger cryptographic guarantees.
Performance results are logged during execution for analysis.
